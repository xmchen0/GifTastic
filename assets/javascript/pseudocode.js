/*
- click button to pull giphy API 
- pull and display 10 images from giphy
- if response call succeed display 10 static images
- if response call failed console log error
- create an array to store list of items 
- loop over array to create buttons
- create an input form and a submit button for submitting new items appended
- submit button should grab the giphy api to make a response request
- when images on loads, click on image to make it move and stop moving
- if clicked on another button, auto populate 10 images with the associated category
- ...sometimes it takes a few clicks to stop the images...
- add new categories to list in the text input and submit into the array
